# Python for Data Science!

This 10-week self-paced course is part of the Data Science MicroMasters program and will introduce you to a collection of powerful, open-source, tools needed to analyze data and to conduct data science. Specifically, you’ll learn how to use:
- python
- jupyter notebooks
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- git
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- And many other tools

You will learn these tools all within the context of solving compelling data science problems.

After completing this course, you’ll be able to find answers within large datasets by using python tools to import data, explore it, analyze it, learn from it, visualize it, and ultimately generate easily sharable reports. You'll also be introduced to Machine Learning techniques and Natural Language Processing tools to expand your data analysis abilities (e.g., being able to analyze twitter data for user sentiments).

By learning these skills, you’ll also become a member of a world-wide community which seeks to build data science tools, explore public datasets, and discuss evidence-based findings. Last but not least, this course will provide you with the foundation you need to succeed in later courses in the Data Science MicroMasters program.

## Your Instructors

_Ilkay Altintas_ is the chief data science officer at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), UC San Diego, where she is also the founder and director for the Workflows for Data Science Center of Excellence. She received her Ph.D. degree from the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands with an emphasis on provenance of workflow-driven collaborative science and she is currently an assistant research scientist at UCSD.

_Leo Porter_ is an Assistant Teaching Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science, specifically computer architecture, from UC San Diego in 2011.

## Earning a Certificate
Verification - Becoming a verified learner allows you access to additional videos, exercise notebooks, and the instructional team to make your experience feel more like it would if you took the course in person at UC San Diego. In addition, earning a verified certificate puts you on the path to a Data Science MicroMasters and possible course credit (see details in the course). Lastly, we know from the data on online courses that registered learners complete courses at a much higher rate than those who do not. As such, we strongly encourage you to register for a verified certificate!

##Honor Code
By enrolling in an edX course, I agree that I will: Complete all tests and assignments on my own, unless collaboration on an assignment is explicitly permitted. Maintain only one user account and not let anyone else use my username and/or password. Not engage in any activity that would dishonestly improve my results, or improve or hurt the results of others. Not post answers to problems that are being used to assess student performance.
